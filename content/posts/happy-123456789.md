Well, it’s been quite a while since I’ve posted.  In fact the last time I posted, the date was a significant math date, as was today.  This time only happens once a century (though 12:34:56 7/8/90 is probably a more significant math date…).  Anyway, we’ve been moving and getting our new house together the past couple months, which is partially the reason for my lack of posting.  Now that we’re mostly done (if you’re a home owner, you know a house is never truly finished fixing…), I will be posting a bit more again.  In the mean time, hope you had a nice 12:34:56 7/8/9 today!
